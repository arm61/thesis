\section*{Abstract}
The work discussed in this chapter is the first example of the use of a chemically-consistent reflectometry model to co-refine X-ray reflectometry\footnote{Abbreviated to XRR.}measurements at different surface pressures.\footnote{Abbreviated to SPs.}
This was coupled with a differential evolution\footnote{DE.} optimisation and Markov chain Monte Carlo\footnote{MCMC.} sampling methodology in order to rationalise the model inverse uncertainties and correlations.
This chemically-consistent modelling approach was applied to the study of phospholipid monolayers at the air-deep eutectic solvent\footnote{Abbreviated to DES.} interface, which required that the head and tail group volumes were not constrained.
By co-refining multiple experimental datasets, it was possible to accurately model the experimental data without these constraints present.
