\section*{Abstract}
The work discussed in this chapter is the first example of the use of a chemically-consistent reflectometry model to co-refine X-ray reflectometry measurements at different surface pressures.
This was coupled with a differential evolution optimisation and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methodology in order to rationalise the parameter inverse uncertainties and correlations.
The chemically-consistent modelling approach was applied to the study of phospholipid monolayers at the air-deep eutectic solvent interface, which required that the head and tail group volume were not constrained.
By co-refining multiple experimental datasets, it was possible to accurately model the experimental data without these constraints present.
