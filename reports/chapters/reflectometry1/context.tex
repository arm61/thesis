\section*{Context}
This project offers a severe method of coarse-graining for the analysis of neutron reflectometry\footnote{NR.} and XRR data.
The system is coarse-grained to represent a head group and a tail group of a phospholipid species.
There is a chemical constraint present in the model, such that the number of head groups must be equal to the number of pairs of tail groups.
However, there is no potential model considered beyond this ``bonded'' interaction.
Additionally, this modelling approach is applied again in Chapter~\ref{reflectometry2}, as an example of the cutting edge of traditional modelling, against which the classical simulation-driven methods are compared.
The specific application of this modelling approach grew from a collaboration with experimental colleagues working on self-assembly in DES.
Therefore, this chemical system will be briefly introduced in Section~\ref{sec:ref1intro}.
However, the main focus of this chapter will be the modelling methodology
