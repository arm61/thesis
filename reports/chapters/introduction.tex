The aim of this work is to investigate a series of different coarse-graining methodologies that can be used in the analysis of scattering data from soft matter.
The coarse-graining used in this work includes traditional potential model coarse-graining,\footnote{Such as the use of the MARTINI potential model.} applying a layer-based coarse-grained description of a surfactant monolayer to the analysis of reflectometry, and developing a severely coarse-grained description of a surfactant molecule to allow the easy generation of realistic starting structures\footnote{For use in classical simulation.} from experimental data.
From this work, I hope that those interested in using coarse-grained approaches for the analysis of scattering data will be able to better understand the avenues that are open to them and the possible pitfalls that are present.
