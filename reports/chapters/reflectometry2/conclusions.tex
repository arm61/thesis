\section{Conclusions}

This chapter presents a direct comparison between a traditional method for the analysis of neutron reflectometry measurements with an analysis method using simulations from a range of all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics potential models.
It was shown that the MARTINI potential model could not accurately reproduce the experimental neutron reflectometry data, likely, due to the limitations of the 4-to-1 beading system when applied to a carbon chain of 18 atoms.

The Berger and Slipids potential models both showed good agreement with the experimental data, however the best agreement was obtained from the traditional chemically-consistent layer model.
This would be expected given that the chemically-consistent model contains many more ``degrees of freedom'' than the simulations which are severely chemically-constrained by the potential model.

Finally, some points from the highest resolution simulations were noted that may be used to improve the chemically-consistent modelling approach.
For example, it is desirable to model the solvation of the phospholipid head grous in a non-uniform fashion.
Application of these improvements may enable the more accurate modelling of phospholipid monolayers from neutron reflectometry.
