\section*{Context}
This chapter builds on the previous chapter, by using the traditional, highly coarse-grained, chemically-consistent layer-based model as a point of comparison with classical molecular simulations that use a variety of simulation grain-sizes, from the coarse-grained MARTINI potential model, to the all-atom Slipids.
Therefore, the analysis in this chapter applies significantly more constraints on the system, however, the constraints are built on substantial underlying chemistry, given their grounding in the potential models.
It is hoped that this work will provide an advisory document to those interested in applying classical simulation to the analysis of their neutron reflectometry experiments.
Furthermore, the simulations are used to advise on ways that the chemically-consistent models may be improved in the future.
It is noted again that the focus of this chapter is the methodological developments, rather than the particular chemical system to which they are applied.
