\section*{Abstract}
Classical molecular dynamics\footnote{MD.} simulations are a common component of multi-modal analyses from scattering measurements, such as small-angle scattering and reflectometry.
Users of these experimental techniques often have no formal training in the theory and practice of MD simulation, leading to the possibility of these simulations being treated as a ``black box'' analysis technique.
In this chapter, two open educational resources\footnote{OERs.}; \texttt{pylj} and ``The Interaction Between Simulation and Scattering'' are described and their utility for introducing users of scattering methods to the tools of MD discussed.
These resources are a Python library designed to allow users to interact with MD simulations and a series of interactive web pages, to introduce classical simulation and how it may be applied to scattering.
