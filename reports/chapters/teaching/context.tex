\section*{Context}
Often users of scattering methods are interested in the use of classical simulation to better understand the results that they have obtained.
However, regularly those with an experimental background aim to apply molecular simulation methods without true consideration of the potential pitfalls of using such methods.
These OERs were developed to introduce experimental colleagues\footnote{Additionally, in the case of \texttt{pylj} undergraduate students.} to classical simulation and molecular dynamics.
They help to facilitate learning by providing a simple, but mathematically rigorous interface and enabling the ``worked example effect'' throughout.
