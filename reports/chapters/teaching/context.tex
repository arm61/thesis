\section*{Context}
Often users of scattering methods are interested in the use of classical simulation to better understand the reuslts that they have obtained.
However, regularly those with an experimental background aim to apply molecular simulation methods without a true consideration of the difficulty of this.
These OERs were developed to introduce experimental colleague (and in the case of \texttt{pylj} undergraduate students) to classical simulation and molecular dynamics.
They reduce the cognitative load necessary to understand these method by providing a simple, but mathematically rigourous interface and enabling the ``worked example effect'' throughout.
