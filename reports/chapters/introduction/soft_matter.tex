Soft matter is an umbrella term for many different types of material.
These include micelles; sub-micron sized, dynamic agglomerates of amphiphilic molecules such as surfactants or block co-polymers, colloidal solutions; where the interaction between the the colloids may be controlled through chemical modification, or proteins; where the polar nature of different amino acids leads to the protein folding into a highly organised, and biologically relevant, shape.
Examples of soft matter systems are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:soft}.
These species, initially, appear rather disparate, however, there are a few important commonalities among soft matter systems \cite{jones_soft_2002}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the lengths scales are intermediate between atomistic and macroscopic; typically in \SIrange{1e-8}{1e-5}{\meter},
  \item for soft matter systems the energy of a structural distortion is similar to thermal energy, so the material in solution is in constant flux,
  \item this thermal motion can lead to the formation of complex, hierarchical structures due to the balance between enthalpy and entropy, this process is refered to as self-assembly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Soft matter self-assembly}

Soft matter self-assembly is the ability for soft matter systems to form organised structures in solution.
These are of particular interest industrially, where surfactant and polymer self-assembly plays an import role in food, commodity, and speciality chemicals \cite{schramm_surfactants_2003}.
Self-assembly processes are important from a biological perspective as it si phospholipids, a family of surface-active biomolecules, which make up the bilayers that protect cells \cite{simons_lipid_2000}.
The structures that result from the self-assembly of soft matter species have fluid-like properties.
This is due to the fact that the subunits are held together by weak forces such as the van der Waals, hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding, and screen electrostatic interactions \cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2011}.
This means that the structure of a self-assembled species is susceptible to changes in the local chemical environment, such as pH or salt concentration \cite{schmaljohann_thermo-_2006,sammalkorpi_ionic_2009}.

The focus of this work is on the self-assembly of surfactant molecules.
Surfactant is a general term for any molecule which is \emph{surface-active}, that is it will interact at an interface \cite{rosen_surfactants_2012}.
Surfactants are generally made up of two components; one part is highly soluble in one of the interfacial phases, while the other is not \cite{goodwin_colloids_2009}.
Usually, surfactants consist of a hydrocarbon tail, which is hdrophobic, and some hydrophilic head groups, which can be ionic or non-ionic.
When surfactants are present in water, the two components will interact different with the solvent.
A hydration sphere of water molecules will form around the hydrophilic head group, effectively allowing the head group to take part in the hydrogen-bonding network of the water.
Whereas, the lyophilic tail has a structure-breaking effect on the hydrogen bonding network, termed the ``hydrophobic effect''.
The free energy deficit of this structure-breaking can be reduced through the aggregation of these hydrophobic groups, as the van der Waals attraction between tail groups is larger than between tail groups and water molecules.
There is a decrease in entropy from the tail organisation, however, this is offset by the entropic increase from the water structure breakup.
Finally, by considering the effect of the, often charged, head groups being close together, it is thought that the majority of the charge can be screened by the presence of a counter-ion, or water molecules, bound to the head group \cite{goodwin_colloids_2009}.
This means that at low concentrations, where it is statistically unlikely for an agglomerate to form, the majority of surfactants will sit at the air-water interface, as the concentration is increased, assuming the system is above the Krafft temperature (the lowest temperature at which agglomerated will form), organised structures wil begin to appear.

%\subsubsection{Thermodynamics of self-assembly}

%The work of Tanford developed the theoretical understanding of the thermodynamics of a self-assembly process \cite{tanford_hydrophobic_1980}, this has then been applied to a wide variety of soft matter systems, such as micelles, bilayers, and microemulsions.
%For any system that is self-assembling in solution, it is necessary that all identical molecules have the same chemical potential, $\mu$.
%This can be expressed as,
%
%\begin{equation}
%\mu = \mu_N = \mu_N^{\circ} + \frac{k_BT}{N} \ln \Bigg(\frac{X_N}{N}\Bigg) = \text{constant},\;\;\;N = 1,\;2,\;3,\ldots,
%\end{equation}
%
%where, $\mu_N$ is the mean chemical potential of a molecule in an aggregate of aggregation number $N$, $\mu_N^{\circ}$ is the mean interaction free energy er molecule in aggregates of aggregation number $N$, and $X_N$ is the concentration of molecules in aggregates of aggregation number $N$.
%From Figure~\ref{fig:thermo} it is possible to describe the rates of association and dissociation of monomers as follows,
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}
%\text{rate of association} & k_1(X_1)^N \\
%\text{rate of dissociation} & k_N\Bigg(\frac{X_N}{N}\Bigg).
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%
%These rates allow for the definition of an equilibrium constant, $K$ for the self-assembly process,
%
%\begin{equation}
%K = \frac{k_1}{k_N} = \exp{\Bigg[\frac{N(\mu_N^\circ - \mu_1^\circ)}{k_BT}\Bigg]}
%\end{equation}
%
%This allows for Equation~\ref{equ:thermo} to be rewritten in a more useful form,
%
%\begin{equation}
%X_N = N \Bigg[X_1\exp\Bigg(\frac{\mu_1^\circ - \mu_N^\circ}{k_BT}\Bigg)\Bigg]^N,
%\label{equ:use}
%\end{equation}
%
%between Equation~\ref{equ:use} and ther conservation relation for the total solute concentration, $C$, the system is completely defined, where,
%
%\begin{equation}
%C = \sum_{N=1}^{\infty}X_N.
%\end{equation}
%
%It should however be noted that this assumed that there is no inter-agglomerate interactions, in scattering terms this means no structure factor.

The structures that are formed from self-assembled surfactant systems are diverse; featuring micellar, hexagonal, cubic, and lamallar mesophases.
These mesphases have a significant impact on the macroscopic properties of the system, for example the liquid crystalline hexagonal phase can have interesting viscoelastic behaviour \cite{jurasin_lamellar_2013,cordobes_linear_1997}.
The mesophase that is formed is dependent on the shape of the underlying surfactants, Israelachvili described this dependency in terms of the dimensionless surfactant packing parameter \cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2011},
%
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{V_c}{a_0l_0},
\end{equation}
%
where, $V_c$ is the volume of the hydrophobic tail, $l_0$ is the length of the tail, and $a_0$ is the optimum head group area.
This parameter can be used to estimate the geometry of the resulting self-assembled structure, detailed in Figure~\ref{fig:pack}.
It is important to note that the optimum head group area accounts for the hydration sphere of the head group.
A short tail surfactant, such as \emph{n}-decyltrimethylammounium bromide, will have a very small packing parameter resulting in small spherical micelles.
Whereas, the twin-tailed phospholipids, such as 1,2-dipalmitoyl-\emph{sn}-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), will have a much larger packing parameter due to the larger tail volume and length, therefore this surfactant will for a lamellar bilayer in solution.

This work will focus on the investigation of surfactant monolayers and micellar systems.
These represent interesting model systems of significant interest both technologically \cite{anton_reverse_2010,zagnoni_miniaturised_2012} and biologically \cite{kataoka_block_2012,mohwald_phospholipid_1990,kewalramani_effects_2010}.
Both of these systems are regularly investigated using X-ray and neutron elastic scattering techniques, with analysis performed in a model-dependent fashion \cite{pambou_structural_2015,hayward_liquid_2015,rodriguez-loureiro_neutron_2017,hazell_langmuir_2016}.

\section{Analysis of soft matter scattering}

The use of neutron and X-ray scattering experiments for the study of soft matter is well developed, with early research into the structure of phospholipid monolayers by reflectometry being conducted in the layer 1970s by Albrecht \emph{et al.} \cite{albrecht_polymorphism_1978}.
While, the work of Kratky and Porod \cite{kratky_diffuse_1949}, who used small angle X-ray scattering for the study of colloidal systems was published in 1949.
Since these early works, the instrumentation developments have enabled more challenging experiments to be conducted, such as time-resolved studies \cite{jensen_monitoring_2014} and the study of floating lipid bilayers \cite{rondelli_reflectivity_2012}.

However, the analysis of soft matter scattering has changed little, still typically involving the use of very coarse models.
These include the shape-based modelling common in small angle scattering (discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sasanal}) \cite{hassan_small_2003} and the layer models (see Section~\ref{sec:refltheory}) \cite{campbell_structure_2018} and functional models \cite{lu_analysis_1996} used in reflectometry analysis.
More sophisticated model refinements have been developed, such as the use of Monte-Carlo sampling \cite{pedersen_monte_2002}, differential evolution optimisation \cite{wormington_characterization_1999}, and Bayesian inference \cite{nelson_refnx_2019}.
However, there has been little evolution in the definition of the models that unpin the analysis process.
Recently, there have been movements towards the use of atomistic modelling techniques, such as molecular dynamics, to augment, and assist, the analysis of soft matter scattering measurements, ion a multi-modal approach \cite{scoppola_combining_2018}.

Much of the work relating to the use of atomistic simulation for the analysis of small angle scattering measurements has been focused on the study of protein molecules in solution.
This is discussed briefly in Chapter~\ref{smallangle}, and has allowed for a more profound understanding of the conformational states available to protein molecules in solution \cite{bowerman_determining_2017}.
The uptake of atomsitic simulation for the analysis of small angle scattering from system such as micelles has been slower, in part due to the larger conformation landscape available to the system under standard conditions.
However, the work of Hargreaves \emph{et al.} pair atomistic simulation (in the from of Emperical Potential Structure Refinement) with total scattering measurements to resolve the structure of an exemplary short-tail surfactant micelle \cite{hargreaves_atomistic_2011}.
Further, the work of Ivanovi\'{c} \emph{et al.} used scattering experiments to refine the output of molecular dynamics simulations of micelles of a pre-defined size \cite{ivanovic_temperature-dependent_2018}.
However, both of these examples required significant computational resource; in the former, the computational time taken was quoted as 200 days, while the later required the running of multiple simulations at different micelle sizes in order to determine the appropriate simulation to analyse.

The use of atomistic simulation for the analysis reflectometry measurements of soft matter systems began with the work of Miller \emph{et al.} and Anderson and Wilson \cite{miller_monte_2003,anderson_molecular_2004}, where atomistic simulation (Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics respectively) was used to study polymer self-assembly at the oil-water interface.
The simulation trajectory was then compared with experimental neutron reflectometry measurements.
Dabkowska \emph{et al.} also used atomistic simulation and neutron reflectometry to study the structure of a surfactant monolayer at the air-water interface, providing the first example of a direct comparison between experimental reflectometry data and that determined from simulation.
To date, there is only one work that uses coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation to aid in the analysis of neutron reflectometry, this is the work of Koutsioubas \cite{koutsioubas_combined_2016}.
This work involved the use of the MARTINI coarse-grained forcefield to simulate a lipid bilayer, and was compared with experimental neutron reflectometry measurements.

\section{Coarse-graining of soft matter systems}

The characteristic non-atomistic length scales associated with soft matter systems makes them ideal for the application of coarse-graining protocols.
Coarse-graining is where dimensionality of a problem is reduced by the removal of certain degrees of freedom from a set.
The most common method of coarse-graining is the re-parameterisation of an atomistic molecular dynamics potential model in terms of this reduced parameter space.
An example of this is the MARTINI forcefield, discussed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:coarsegraining}, where the system is parameterised without loss of chemical information.
The result of coarse-graining is to create a flatter potential energy landscape, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cg}.
However, in this work I have also investigated the effect of applying a chemically-consistent coarse-grained monolayer model for the analysis of reflectometry data (Chapter~\ref{reflectometry1}), where the system is coarse-grained to describe a phospholipid material as consisting of a head group and pair of tail groups.
In addition to the assessment of the severe coarse-graining protocol, I have assessed the efficacy of different atomistic and coarse-grained potential models for the analysis of neutron reflectometry, building on the work of Dabkowska \emph{et al.} and Koutsioubas \cite{koutsioubas_combined_2016} (Chapter~\ref{reflectometry2}).

\section{Optimisation methodologies}

The availability of high performance computing has increased significantly in recent year, in particular due to cloud-based infrastructures.
Furthermore, highly parallelisable optimisation algorithms are now available such as the particle swarm optimisation \cite{kennedy_particle_1995,shi_modified_1998} and the differtial evolution \cite{storn_differential_1997}.
As mentioned above, previous work has shown that the simulation of a surfactant micelle and comparison with experimental data requires significant computational expense \cite{hargreaves_atomistic_2011,ivanovic_temperature-dependent_2018}.
In the interest of reducing this expense, and improving the applicibility of high performance computing to the simulation driven analysis of small angle scattering I have investigated the use of particle swarm optimisation to produce a realistic near-atomistic micelle structure based on experimental data alone.
This has made use of a coarse-grained description of a surfactant molecule on two levels; one for the particle swarm optimisation and another for the potential energy minimisation (Chapter~\ref{smallangle}).

\section{Educational materials}

While the development of analytical methods and infrastructure is important for the development and uptake of the simulation-driven analysis methods applied in this work, the development of informatative resources is also necessary.
Current experimental users of small angle scattering are not typically familiar with detailed aspects of classical simulation, but are interested in applying it to assist with their analyses.
Therefore, alongside this traditional reserach application, I have been developing open educational resources designed to introduce classical simulation techniques, and in particular to allow users of scattering techniques to become familiar with the utility of these methods for assisting with the analysis of small angle scattering experiments (Chapter~\ref{teaching}).
