\section{Educational materials}

While the development of analytical methods and infrastructure is important for the development and uptake of the simulation-driven analysis methods applied in this work, the development of informatative resources is also necessary.
Current experimental users of small angle scattering are not typically familiar with detailed aspects of classical simulation, but are interested in applying it to assist with their analyses.
Therefore, alongside this traditional reserach application, I have been developing open educational resources designed to introduce classical simulation techniques, and in particular to allow users of scattering techniques to become familiar with the utility of these methods for assisting with the analysis of small angle scattering experiments (Chapter~\ref{teaching}).
