\section{Educational materials}
While the development of analytical methods and infrastructure are important for the development and uptake of the simulation-driven analysis methods applied in this work, the development of informative resources is also necessary.
Current experimental users of SAS are typically not familiar with detailed aspects of classical simulation, however, they are often interested in applying it to assist with their analyses.
Therefore, alongside traditional research applications, I have been developing open educational resources\footnote{Abbreviated to OERs.} designed to introduce classical simulation techniques, and to allow users of scattering techniques to become familiar with these.
The ambition being that as the availability of simulation-driven analysis for SAS grows, so will the user base that is familiar with the underlying methods.\footnote{See Chapter~\ref{teaching}.}
