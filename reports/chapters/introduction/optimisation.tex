\section{Optimisation methodologies}
The availability of high performance computing has increased significantly in recent years, in particular due to cloud-based infrastructures.
Furthermore, highly parallelisable optimisation algorithms are now available such as the particle swarm\autocite{kennedy_particle_1995,shi_modified_1998} and DE\autocite{storn_differential_1997} optimisations.
As mentioned above, previous work has shown that the simulation of a surfactant micelle and comparison with experimental data requires significant computational expense\autocite{hargreaves_atomistic_2011,ivanovic_temperature-dependent_2018}
In the interest of reducing this, and improving the applicibility of high performance computing to simulation-driven analysis of small angle scattering I have investigated the use of a particle swarm optimisation\footnote{Abbreviated to PSO.} to produce a realistic, near-atomistic micelle structure based on experimental data alone.
This has made use of a coarse-grained description of a surfactant molecule on two levels; one for the PSO and another for the scattering profile calculation.\footnote{See Chapter~\ref{smallangle}.}.
