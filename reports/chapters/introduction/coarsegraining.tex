The characteristic non-atomistic length scales associated with soft matter systems make them ideal for the application of coarse-graining protocols.
Coarse-graining is where the dimensionality of a problem is reduced by the removal of certain degrees of freedom from a set.
The most common method of coarse-graining is the re-parameterisation of an atomistic potential model in terms of this reduced parameter space.
An example of this is the MARTINI potential model,\footnote{This specific model is discussed in greater detail in Section~\ref{sec:coarsegraining}.} where the aim is to reparameterise the system without significant loss of chemical information.\autocite{marrink_martini_2007}
A result of coarse-graining is the creation of a flatter potential energy landscape, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cg}.
The availability of coarse-grained potential models and tools for coarse-graining has allowed for very large simulations to be performed, such as the simulation of large polymeric species,\autocite{carbone_transferability_2008} phosphoplipid nanodiscs,\autocite{xue_molecular_2018} and realistic biomembranes.\autocite{marrink_computational_2019}
Furthermore, these coarse-grained potential model have shown the ability to reproduce experimental measurements.\autocite{negro_experimental_2014,nawaz_interactions_2012}

However, in this work I have used the term ``coarse-graining'' broadly to include the applications of a chemically-consistent coarse-grained monolayer model for the analysis of reflectometry data,\footnote{This work is the focus of Chapter~\ref{reflectometry1}.}
In addition to the assessment of different atomistic and coarse-grained potential models for the analysis of NR, building on the work of Dabkowska \emph{et al.} and Koutsioubas.\autocite[][see Chapter~\ref{reflectometry2}]{dabkowska_modulation_2014,koutsioubas_combined_2016}
