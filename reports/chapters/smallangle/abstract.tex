\section*{Abstract}
The simulation of micellar species is a non-trival task, and currently many simulations still underestimated the micelle size and are unable to model micelle-micelle interations.
This chapter represents an attempt to apply a high-performance computing compatible optimiastion methodology to the generation of micellar structures, containing hundreds of molecules, based on the experimental small angle scattering alone.
The software \texttt{fitoog} was developed to perform this, using a severe coarse-graining method to describe the molecules within the optimisation.
This software is open-source and well parallelised enabling it to be run on high-performance computing resources.
While \texttt{fitoog} was capable of optimising a simple test case, the high parameter dimensionality required to produce a realistic micellar species was not able to be overcome.
