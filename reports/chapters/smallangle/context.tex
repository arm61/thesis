\section*{Context}
The work contained in this chapter moves from coarse grained representations of interfaces to those of solutions.
The use of classical simulation as a tool to assist small angle scattering analysis is popular in the biomolecular community.\autocite{perkins_atomistic_2016,hub_interpreting_2018}
However, its use in the study of other soft matter species, such as micelles, is limited due to the significant computational cost of obtaining a starting structure that is similar to the experimental system.
While it is possible to produce a series of simulations of various micelle sizes and compare these with experimental data, the desire to model the inter-micelle interactions means that these method quickly become unfeasible.
Herein, the generation of a starting structure for a molecular dynamics\footnote{MD.} simulation from scattering data is treated as an optimisation problem and a particle swarm optimisation\footnote{PSO.} algorithm is applied to attempt to resolve it.
The aim is to obtain a starting structure that is representative of the experimental system, including scattering from inter-micelle interactions.
