\chapter{Additional Code Blocks for Differential Evolution} % Main appendix title
\label{diff_evo_app} % Change X to a consecutive letter; for referencing this appendix elsewhere, use \ref{AppendixX}
This appendix includes additional Code Blocks relevant to the introduction of the DE optimisation method discussed in Section~\ref{sec:de}.
Code Block~\ref{cb:mut} describes the mutation step of the DE algorithm, as described by Bj\"{o}rck.\sidecite<-1\baselineskip>{bjorck_fitting_2011}

The input variables are \texttt{p} which is an array of floats representing the parent population, \texttt{b} which is an array of floats representing the best vector of the parent population, and \texttt{km} the mutant constant. This function returns an array of floats representing the mutant vector.}

Code Block~\ref{cb:recomb} describes the recombination step of the DE algorithm, as described by Bj\"{o}rck.

The input variables are \texttt{p} which is an array of floats representing the parent population, \texttt{m} which is an array of floats representing the mutant vector, and \texttt{kr} the recombination constant. This function returns an array of floats representing the offspring population.}

\begin{listing}

    \caption[-2\baselineskip]{The classical selection step used in a DE algorithm, as described in \cite{bjorck_fitting_2011}. The input variables are \texttt{p} which is an array of floats representing the parent population, \texttt{m} which is an array of floats representing the offspring vector, and \texttt{f} is the function to be minimised. This function returns an array of floats representing the new parent population.}
