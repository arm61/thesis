    """
    Determines the scattering length density profile along the z-axis of a
    molecular dynamics output file (PDB format, unless MDAnalysis is
    installed). Lateral averaging occurs in the x-y plane.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pdbfile: str or file-like
        The path and name of the .pdb file or for which the reflectometry
        should be found.
    layer_thickness: float, optional
        The thickness of the layers that the simulation cell should be sliced
        into. This will depend on the size of the particles in the simulation,
        for example a coarse-grained forcefield simulation will require thicker
        layers to stop overbinning.
    cut_off: float, optional
        The thickness (in the z-dimension) of the volume of the bottom
        simulation cell that should be ignored. This is to allow for the use of
        a vacuum gap in the simulation cell. This thickness can be determined
        by visualising the simulation or by running the box with a cut-off of 0
        and investigating the SLD profile that is produced. N.B. This cut_off
        occurs AFTER the flip (if this parameter is true).
    flip: bool, optional
        False if the system should be read as is, True if the simulation cell
        should be mirrored through the xy-plane. The neutrons or X-ray are
        incident at the bottom of the simulation cell (where z=0), therefore
        if the radiation should be incident at the top of the cell flip should
        be true.
    roughness: float, optional
        The fraction (of the layer thickness) roughness to be considered
        between the layers in the simulation cell.
    verbose: bool, optional
        True if you want to be notified when the pdb and lgt files have been
        read and when the sld profile is calculated.
    structure: biopython.structure, attribute
        The is the object which contains the information read in from the
        simulation trajectory.
    dimensions: float, array_like, attribute
        An array of 3 floats containing the simulation cell dimensions.

        If a series of atom_types and scattering_lengths are defined these will

        the simulation based on the 'element' defined in the pdb file (the
        final column in each row), the scattering_length is taken from the
        periodictable library.

        Parameters
        ----------
        radiation: str
            Either 'neutron' or 'xray'. This is the type of radiation that was
            used in the experimental reflectometry measurements.
        xray_energy: float, optional
            Only required if the radiation is 'xray'. This is the energy of the
            probing X-ray radiation, in units of kilo electron Volts
        lgtfile: str, optional
            The path and name of the .lgt file (if present), which contains the
            scattering lengths of each of the atom type in the pdbfile. This is
            important for the reading in of scattering lengths that cannot be
            assigned based on the atom, such as for coarse-grained forcefields.
        atom_types: str, array_like, optional
            An array of length N, where N is the number of atom types in the
            simulation trajectory, which defines the atom types to assign
            scattering lengths. These must have the same ordering as the
            scattering lengths.
        scattering_lengths: float, array_like, optional
            An array of shape [N, 2], where N is the number of atom types in
            the simulation trajectory, which defines the scattering lengths for
            the given atom types (where the first column are the real
            scattering lengths and the second column are the imaginary
            scattering lengths).

        space-separated txt file where the columns are atom_type,
        real_scattering_length, and imaginary_scattering_length respectively.
        If a lgtfile is not used the scattering lengths for the system will be
        determined based on the element type that is defined in the final
        column of the pdb file.
